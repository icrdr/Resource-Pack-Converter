# Resource Pack Converter for Minecraft 1.13
A tool for converting Minecraft's resource pack from 1.8-1.12 to 1.13

There are a great number of changes to Minecraft 1.13 resource pack (Java Edition). It would be terrible to change all the files' name manually. Here is a list of the changes: https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.13/Flattening </br>
This tool will automatically convert all files including **models**. I tested it for [Mizuno's 16 Craft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/mizunos-16-craft/) (my girlfriend's favorite pack) and [ZigZag](http://www.jmckiernan.com/), and it works just fine. It may not convert everything perfectly, however it offers the easiest way to get your pack compatible with 1.13 quickly.

**For Creators**: it provides a starting pack from your old version.</br>
**For Players**: you don't have to wait the pack's author to update.</br>
